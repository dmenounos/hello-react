# Hello React

A simple web application using the [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) framework.

The configuration aims to contain a minimal set of dependecies to compile and develop the code.

* React 16.13.0
* Babel 6.26.3
* Webpack 4.41.6

We also have to have installed the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) runtime environment.

* To begin the development server run: `npm run start`
* To create the production bundle run: `npm run build`

We plan to support at least the following features:

* Hello World with minimal build configuration (v1.0.0)
* Navigation with React Router (v2.0.0)
* Bootstrap integration (v3.0.0)
* Multiple modules
